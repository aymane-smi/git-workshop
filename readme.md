## 1- Introduction

For now, I assume that you know what the Git system is. Before we dive in, I want to give you a quick recap on some basics before moving on:
- Let's start with ```git init```:
git init is a command that will create for us a folder dedicated to Git where the Git magic happens; the folder is called ```.git```.
- After creating the Git repository, we can move to the next important command, which is ```git add```:
git add gives us the possibility to move files from the untracked stage to the tracked stage, or in other words, move files from local to a remote branch. To do this easily, we can use the command ```git add .``` to add all the modified files or ```git add file1 file2...``` to add specific files only.
- After finishing the addition of the wanted files, we use the command ```git commit```: this command gives the possibility to move the added file(s) to a commit. But before this, what is a commit? In general, a commit is a piece of history in our repository where it saves the exact state of the file(s) in order to have some traceability over them. To do so, we can use the whole commit command ```git commit -m "message1" "message2 to add to the body if you want"```.

There is another command for Git commit, ``--amend``; it's up to you to search it üòÅ.
- Last but not least, the loved command ```git push```. You want to know what it will do, right? Relax, how are you going to transfer your files to your lovely GitHub, GitLab,... repository to showcase, flex on your friends, or whatever? For that, you're going to use ```git push```, not ```git pull```. In general, if you want to push changes on the branch that you are working on, just use ```git push```; if not, you can use ```git push origin_name wanted_branch```.

And voil√†, now you have the basics to continue the journey with usüëçüèª
